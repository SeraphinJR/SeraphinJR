# About Me


**SeraphinJR/SeraphinJR** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pyhton
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something low level
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can move my ears(?)
